# Extension-Fix

**Extension-Fix** is a patch designed to enhance the compatibility of extensions in certain applications by injecting `ExtensionFix.dylib` into the app's framework or binary. This allows previously non-functional extensions to work seamlessly without modifying the original source code.

## Features
- **Automatic injection into iOS apps** using `Azule` or `insert_dylib`
- **Compatible with various apps** that utilize extension-based systems
- **Flexible injection methods**, supporting `@executable_path` and `@loader_path`
- **Easy to use**, simply run the injector script to patch the application

## Usage
Just fork & run action
